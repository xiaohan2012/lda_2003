Python Implementation of "Latent Dirichlet Allocation, David, Blei, 2003"

# What is ready

- Estimation algorithm implementation

# What is missing

- Inference algorithm implementation
- The smoothing factor for the topic word parameter `\beta`

# WARNING

It's still unknown whether the estimation implementation is correct or not, though tests have been written and the increase of lower bound can be seen during training.
